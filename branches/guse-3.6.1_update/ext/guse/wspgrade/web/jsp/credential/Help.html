        <H3>Certificate Portlet Description</H3>
        <p>This portlet can be used for handling certificates.<br />
            Three certificate formats are supported: SAML Assertion, P12 and PEM files.<br />
            SAML assertion is used for submitting jobs in the D-Grid (MoSGrid) infrastructure.<br />
            P12 and PEM files are used for accessing files via XTreemFS. </p>

        First you can select the option by selecting the appropriate radio button. <br />
        If you select the SAML radiobutton, you can do two things:<br />
        <OL>
            <LI> Upload an existing SAML Assertion.
            <LI> Generate a SAML Assertion. (The applet appears).
        </OL>
        If you select the P12 radiobutton, you can do the following things:
        <OL>
            <LI>Upload the certificate, which is in pkcs12 format.
            <LI>Fill in the details needed for the MyProxy server.
        </OL>
        If you select the PEM radiobutton, you can do the following things:
        <OL>
            <LI>Upload the key and public certificate, which is in pem format.
            <LI>Fill in the details needed for the MyProxy server.
        </OL>
        Messages appear at the bottom of the portlet to guide you, such as: "Fill in the details."
        <br />
        After you filled in the required details, you have to press the Upload button.
        <br />
        Then the portal uploads the file(s) for you.
        <br />
