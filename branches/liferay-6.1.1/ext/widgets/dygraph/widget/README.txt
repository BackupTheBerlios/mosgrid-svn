- Theres an article on the useage of the Dygraph widget in the developer-wiki.

- Keep the dygraph.jar in the project synchronized with the file on the webserver

- Use the MANIFEST.MF in WebContent/META-INF for building the jar

- You can compile the widgetset locally if you change to DefaultWidgetSet in gwt.xml

- You only have to recompile the widgetset after changes in classes in the widget package
