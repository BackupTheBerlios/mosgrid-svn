This package contains a modification to the official CAS server that allows to
extract the Email address from certificates and to redirect in case of any login failure.

To build it run

   mvn clean package 

in the base directory. This command will build the package. Afterwards you can find the file


   cas.war in the target directory.

Another option is prepared if you want to change the login flow to check Liferay passwords, too:

  mvn clean package -P liferay

This profile needs some adoption. On the one hand you have to register certain libraries in the maven 
repository (instructions are contained in pom.xml). On the other hand the dependencies are not sorted 
out fully, yet. The required classes must be unpacked by maven. Otherwise the dependencies interact too 
much with each other, unnecessarily blowing up the .war file.
